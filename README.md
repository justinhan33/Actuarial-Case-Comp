# CAL Ninth Actuarial Case Competition
The Cal Actuarial League's Actuarial Case Competition is designed to provide participants with the opportunity to work with actuarial data to solve problems and present business solutions to professional actuaries.

This case competition was the ninth annual competition and consisted of three different tracks: Health & Benefits**, Property & Casualty, and Retirement.

The sponsors of the Ninth Annual Actuarial Case Competition (creators of the cases) include:
1. **Health & Benefits**: Beam Dental
2. **Property & Casualty**: CSAA Insurance Group
3. **Retirement**: Aon

Various UC schools took part in the Ninth Annual Actuarial Case Competition. To be eligible, each team was required to have four members, and each participating school was allowed to have multiple teams. Up to nine teams were selected to participate in the final round, and presented in front of a panel of actuaries from renowned consulting and insurance companies.

I would like to thank my teammates, **Ajay Damodaran**, **Jonathan Boyle**, and **Thomas Beck**, for their hard work and contributions. With our combined efforts, our team was able to qualify for the final round for two out of the three tracks: Property & Casualty andÂ Retirement.
